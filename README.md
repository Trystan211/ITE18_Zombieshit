Story:
This project is an interactive game environment designed for users to engage with animations and a customizable canvas. 
The goal is to provide an immersive and visually appealing zombie game experience, leveraging modern web technologies to achieve seamless interactivity and responsiveness. 
The story takes place in an aftermath of a mysterious viral outbreak, the world has plunged into chaos. Once-thriving cities are now desolate wastelands crawling with the undead. 
You play as a survivor in this zombie apocalypse, fighting to stay alive in a hostile world. Armed with supply of weapons and ammunition, your mission is to fend off waves of zombies and survive to one day uncover the truth behind the outbreak.
As the game progresses, the stakes grow higher. The zombies become faster, smarter, and more relentless, testing your strategy and reflexes.
